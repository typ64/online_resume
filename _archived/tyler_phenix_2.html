<li>adoptability with environments, people, and technology</li>
</ul>
</p>
My 4 years of computer science/information technology experience in the industry and in academics, along with many hours of personal practice, have given me a solid foundation for this position. With this experience, I am comfortable performing a wide range of job duties and I am a zealous worker both independently and with a team or teams.
