<p>Dear <span class="company"></span>,</p>

<p>I found your posting on Indeed for a <span class="position"></span> which immediately caught my attention. I just graduated college in December of 2017, with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Information Technology, and a <span class="position"></span> position would be a great fit for me to apply my knowledge of data analytics and development.</p>

<p>Since graduating from Metropolitan Community College of Kansas City in 2014, with an Associate Degree in Computer Science, I have worked as a; Web Content Intern, for a little over a year; a Service Desk Analyst II, for 7 months; and as an Information Security Intern for 6 months, which is my current job.</p>

<p>All 3 of the computer science/information technology jobs I have had, plus my academic work, make me a great candidate for this position. Both my industry and academic work have provided to me experience with:
<ul>

<li>submitting code to production</li>
<li>using version control software (e.g. GitHub) when working with a team and independently</li>
<li>following agile planning processes and frameworks (e.g. Scrum, Test-Driven Development [TDD], etc.)</li>
<li>team work - both in leadership roles/positions and more subordinate roles/potions within the company and/or within a group for projects</li>
<li>communication and understanding between myself and individuals with all levels of technical competency</li>
<li>a wide range of languages, frameworks, and modules (please see resume for more detail)</li>
<li>risk management (e.g. risk analysis, risk avoidance, risk mitigation, risk transfer, risk retention, etc.)</li>
<li>adoptability with environments, people, and technology</li>
</ul>
</p>
My 4 years of computer science/information technology experience in the industry and in academics, along with many hours of personal practice, have given me a solid foundation for this position. With this experience, I am comfortable performing a wide range of job duties and I am a zealous worker both independently and with a team or teams. I am eager to contribute my enthusiasm and skills to <span class="company"></span> and to grow in this position.</p>
